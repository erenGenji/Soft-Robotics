# Soft-Robotics FUKUSHIMA-HAIRO project

This competition simulates an investigation inside the containment vessel 
(PCV) of the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant (NPP). The interior 
investigation will be conducted by accessing the inside of the PCV through the 
X-1 penetration or small-diameter piping, retrieving objects present at the 
bottom, and returning to the PCV.

- （Note 1）The dimensions of the staircase are 550 mm wide, 65 degrees in angle, and 285 mm above the kick-off. 
- （Note 2）The object depicted in yellow is a structure of some kind.

The X-1 penetration has an opening of 
500 mm in diameter, and the small-diameter pipe has a nominal diameter of 
40 (Sekisui VP pipe 40).

There is a stair landing approximately 0.5 meters wide along the way. 
It then travels approximately 1.7 meters to the worker opening, retrieves the 
object, and returns to the starting position. The smallest narrow part of the 
travel path is 0.5 meters wide. 

The robot will pass through a 3 meters small-diameter piping and
through a grating gap, and then descends about 4 meters. After processing, 
it travels approximately 3.3 meters toward the worker opening, retrieves the 
object, and returns to the starting position. 

The object to be collected is a cube (made of acrylic) with 10 mm on each 
side.
