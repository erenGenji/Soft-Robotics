This competition simulates an investigation inside the containment vessel 
(PCV) of the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant (NPP). The interior 
investigation will be conducted by accessing the inside of the PCV through the 
X-1 penetration or small-diameter piping, retrieving objects present at the 
bottom, and returning to the PCV. 



The X-1 penetration has an opening of 
500 mm in diameter, and the small-diameter pipe has a nominal diameter of 
40 (Sekisui VP pipe 40).
